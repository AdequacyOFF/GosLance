I need to create a simple intuitive GUI for a neural network.
Stack: React + TypeScript + FSD 
Name: GosLance
Come up with a nice short slogan: What's the point, our application is a kind of freelance platform for government contractors who are hired to work as an outsourcing company for EIS. Not just b2b or b2s
What I want to see:
2 pages: profile and government orders exchange.
- The profile should be a chatbot with an assistant who will ask you leading questions. The first question is: "Write down who you are (who your team is, what you do). Your project portfolio." The person should give a detailed answer, then they should ask "What is your current employment, what are you currently working on?" The user gives a detailed answer. Then a button appears above the chat window above the chat input field: "Start search". The chatbot should be similar to the interface shown in screenshot 1.png
- After clicking on the "Start search" button, we are thrown into the exchange window, where the neural network highlights the most suitable applications for government orders. The page should look like the screenshot 2.png 
General: Beautiful modern, simple interface. Use the black and blue cevets.
Use mock data from standard questions as the assistant's questions. Then, after answering all the questions, after clicking on the "Start search" button, all the user's answers are sent to the neural network at once.
